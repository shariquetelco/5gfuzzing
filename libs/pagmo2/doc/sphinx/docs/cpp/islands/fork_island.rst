Fork island
===========

.. versionadded:: 2.9

*#include <pagmo/islands/fork_island.hpp>*

.. note::

   The :cpp:class:`~pagmo::fork_island` class is available only on POSIX platforms (e.g., Linux, OSX,
   the BSDs, but *not* Microsoft Windows, unless some POSIX compatibility layer has been installed
   on the system).

.. cpp:namespace-push:: pagmo

.. cpp:class:: fork_island

   This user-defined island (UDI) will use the POSIX ``fork()`` system call to offload the evolution
   of a population to a child process.

   Generally speaking, users are encouraged to use :cpp:class:`~pagmo::thread_island` rather than
   :cpp:class:`~pagmo::fork_island`: :cpp:class:`~pagmo::thread_island` performs better,
   it works also with problems and algorithms which are not serialisable, and it is available on all
   platforms.

   :cpp:class:`~pagmo::fork_island` should however be preferred when dealing with problems and algorithms
   which do not offer the basic :cpp:type:`~pagmo::thread_safety` guarantee. By offloading the optimisation
   to a separate process (rather than a separate thread), :cpp:class:`~pagmo::fork_island` can ensure
   that thread-unsafe problems and algorithms are always run in only one thread at a time.
   This capability is particularly useful when wrapping in pagmo third-party code which does not support execution
   in multithreaded contexts (a notable example is the :cpp:class:`~pagmo::ipopt` algorithm,
   which uses the thread-unsafe Ipopt optimiser).

   :cpp:class:`~pagmo::fork_island` is the UDI type automatically selected by the constructors of :cpp:class:`~pagmo::island`
   on POSIX platforms when the island's problem and/or algorithm do not provide the basic :cpp:type:`~pagmo::thread_safety`
   guarantee.

   .. note::

      When using memory checking tools such as valgrind, or the address/memory sanitizers from GCC/clang, be aware
      that memory leaks in the child process may be flagged by such tools. These are spurious warnings due to the
      fact that the child process is exited via ``std::exit()`` (which does not invoke the destructors
      of objects with automatic storage duration). Thus, such warnings can be safely ignored.

   .. note::

      The ability of the forked process to handle errors raised during evolution is dependent on the
      specific ``fork()`` implementation in use. For instance, it has been reported that on recent OSX versions
      (i.e., since High Sierra), error handling in the forked process does not work, possibly because it employs
      code which is not `asynchronous-safe <http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal-safety.7.html>`__.

   .. cpp:function:: fork_island()
   .. cpp:function:: fork_island(const fork_island &)
   .. cpp:function:: fork_island(fork_island &&) noexcept

      :cpp:class:`~pagmo::fork_island` is default, copy and move-constructible. The copy and move constructor are equivalent
      to the default constructor.

   .. cpp:function:: void run_evolve(island &isl) const

      This method will fork the calling process, and, in the child process, the :cpp:class:`~pagmo::population` of *isl* will be
      evolved using the :cpp:class:`~pagmo::algorithm` of *isl*. At the end of the evolution, the evolved population and the
      algorithm used for the evolution will be sent back to the parent process, where they will replace, in *isl*, the original
      population and algorithm. The child process will then terminate via ``std::exit(0)``.

      If any exception is raised during the evolution, the error message from the exception will be transferred back to the parent
      process, where a ``std::runtime_error`` containing the error message from the child will be raised.

      :param isl: the :cpp:class:`~pagmo::island` that will be evolved.

      :exception std\:\:runtime_error: if any error arises from the use of POSIX primitives (``fork()``, pipes, etc.), or if any
         error is generated in the child process.
      :exception unspecified: any exception raised by:

         - the serialisation of :cpp:class:`~pagmo::population` or :cpp:class:`~pagmo::algorithm`,
         - :cpp:func:`pagmo::island::set_population()` or :cpp:func:`pagmo::island::set_algorithm()`.

   .. cpp:function:: std::string get_name() const

      :return: the string ``"Fork island"``.

   .. cpp:function:: std::string get_extra_info() const

      :return: if an evolution is ongoing, this method will return a string
         representation of the ID of the child process. Otherwise, the ``"No active child"`` string will be returned.

   .. cpp:function:: pid_t get_child_pid() const

      :return: a signed integral value representing the process ID of the child process, if an evolution is ongoing. Otherwise,
         ``0`` will be returned.

   .. cpp:function:: template <typename Archive> void serialize(Archive &, unsigned)

      Serialisation support.

      Note that :cpp:class:`~pagmo::fork_island` is stateless, and thus this (de)serialisation function is empty and performs no work.
